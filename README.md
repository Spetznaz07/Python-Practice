## Some golden rules before you start coding
‚Ä¢ Don't get dis-hearted if your code is not running in first attempt.

‚Ä¢ Code to learn and learn to code

‚Ä¢ Try to consolidate code

‚Ä¢ Always write code so others can also understand (add comments)

Hope this helps to start your journey with me üòÑüòÑ
